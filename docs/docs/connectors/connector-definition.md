## What is a connector
Prancer cloud validation framework can connect to various API providers to get data. To connect to those providers, we need a **connector configuration file**. This connector configuration file has information about how to connect to that API provider and the credential we need to do that.

## Supported providers
Currently the following providers are supported in the connector configuration file:

- Filesystem
